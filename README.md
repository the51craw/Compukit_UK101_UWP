# Compukit_UK101_UWP
Emulator for an early personal computer, the UK101 from Compukit LTD featuring 
machine code monitor CEGMON Â© 1980 George Chkiantz, Richard Elen, Tom Graves, 
8K Basic by Microsoft and a MIDI implementation by me (written in machine code). 

This code may only be used if you already own a UK101 computer. If you do not, 
you will violate the access rights regarding the CEGMON and 8K Basic softwares.

This is still a work in progress, and some features are not implemented yet.

In this version, emulation of MIDI and ACIA hardware is not implemented, however
it is possible to run the emulator:

Run the app.
Press Esc to reset.
Press M for machine code monitor or B for Microsoft 8k Basic.

MIDI rom is accessible from machine code monitor at 8000.
Reset and press M.
Type in 8000 and press G.
